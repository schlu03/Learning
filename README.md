Repo to track my learning path

I've created this repo to track my progress and learn more about:
    - Data Science
    - Python
    - Quantum Computing

To start i'm doing the basic process using VS Code and Git.

Today I have come back to do my courses and improve my skills.
Hope I did a way of work and can close all the courses I have access.
